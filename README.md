# Triangular numbers which are perfect squares

A triangular number is the sum of all positive real integers up to n.
Sometimes, it happens that the result is a perfect square
The numbers meeting this condition get large very quickly
This generates results, until the resulting triangular number would be over a googol!

Thanks to decimal.js for handling big numbers and Wolfram Alpha for hints around the algebra

Code to generate the 10,000th one included, which takes a few seconds
